    Hi !! This is Nishmitha PradeepKumar.

    I am currently working on CRM tool and have enhanced few changes in crm tool.
    And Now I am learning web development.

    My Fav Movies 

    1.Sillunu oru Kadhal (Tamil Movie) - Basically I like hero Suriya..so obviously I liked that movie very much.
    And in general I really love to watch sci-fi, thriller movies like Interstellar, Gone girl etc.,
    I am not a fan of RomCom or Romantic genres.
